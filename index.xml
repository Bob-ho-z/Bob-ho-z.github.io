      <description>I did a project called VivaBleeRaw in cooperation with other friends outside of class. I did part of the UI of the VivaBlee website, and I also used react native to do the VivaBleeRaw Android UI. However, due to the change of designed ideas, the app and web interface have been changed many times.The pages I designed have also been modified. https://github.com/Bob-ho-z/Vivablee_

      <description>Hello, my name is He Zhanbo. I am currently in the third year of Computer Science at CUHK.
Personal character I like learning new knowledge and exploring different things. Learning new knowledge can bring me a sense of success. In addition, I am more inclined to set a goal for myself and make a plan before do something. Setting a goal makes me feel certain and knows what I am doing.</description>

      <description>This is a project I completed on a programming course in year 1. In fact, it is a card game where two players play against each other. A deck of 52 cards is placed on the table. Each round one player turns over two cards. If the two cards have the same value, the player scores. The two cards become uncover. You can choose these two cards again until all the cards are turned over.</description>
